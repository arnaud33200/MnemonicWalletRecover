# MnemonicWalletRecover

a simple project, I got frustrated that I couldn't find any tools to get my crypto wallet private back from 12 words seed (mnemonic).
I've created those wallets with my company and I still have the code for this part.

So here is a simple one screen to enter 12 words and see the private key.
I will upload the apk so I can use this app any time
